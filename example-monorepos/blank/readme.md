## 🔦 About

This monorepo is a blank(ish) starter for an Expo + Next.js app.

While it's pretty barebones, it does a lot of the annoying config for you. The folder structure is opinionated, based on my long experience building for this stack.

## 📦 Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- `moti` for animations
- Expo SDK 53
- Next.js 15
- React Navigation 7
- React 19 (read more below)
- React Compiler

## React 19 support

Getting React 19 working properly in this monorepo was tricky. If you're referencing this monorepo for your own existing project, here is what you need to do to get it working:

1. Add `react@rc` and `react-dom@rc` to the `package.json` of `apps/next`. They **must** be the v19 RC version, such as `19.0.0-rc.1`.
2. **Remove** `react` from the `package.json` of `apps/expo` (super important).
3. **Set** `experiments.reactCanary` to `true` in the `app.json` of `apps/expo`.
4. Run `yarn` and restart everything.

To confirm you did this properly, try `yarn why react`. If you see it installed more than once, something is likely going to break.

If you miss one of those steps, either your website or app will likely not work.

### Why

At the time of updating this monorepo, React 19 is in RC, and Next.js 15 requires using the RC version of React. Meanwhile, Expo SDK 52 only supports using React 19 via the `app.json => reactCanary` flag. This combination of steps was the only way I could get it working without having yarn hoisting issues.

If you try installing React 18 in `apps/expo` and 19 RC in `apps/next`, suddenly the Next.js website will fail to pick up the correct React version.

### React Compiler

This monorepo has the React Compiler enabled. There are distinct steps to get it working in Next.js and React Native.

## 🗂 Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## 🏁 Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev:
  - First, build a dev client onto your device or simulator
    - `cd apps/expo`
    - Then, either `expo run:ios`, or `eas build`
  - After building the dev client, from the root of the monorepo...
    - `yarn native` (This runs `expo start --dev-client`)

## 🆕 Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).
