title: Starter Project
---

To get you up and running instantly, I created a starter monorepo with all the annoying config done for you.

You can see the monorepo and what comes installed [here](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos/blank).

## Start from the terminal

You can install the starter app using the CLI:

```sh
npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app
```

## Start from Vercel

If you prefer, click this button and you can instantly deploy the Next.js example to Vercel for free:

Be sure to select `apps/next` as the root directory in the project settings.

Deploying to Vercel will create a new git repo for you.

For now, there is only one template available.
