title: Upgrade to Solito 2
id: v2
---

Solito 2 is a big step for the React Native + Next.js stack:

- **New `solito/image`:** Optimized cross-platform images
  - `next/image` on Web
  - `react-native-fast-image` on iOS & Android
  - Expo Go support
- **Next.js 13 support**
  - `Link` and `TextLink` support
  - Upgraded example monorepos
- Native stack `replace()` support

## `solito/image`

Optimized images are one of the most-requested features for cross-platform development.

Solito 2 introduces [`SolitoImage`](/usage/image), which wraps `next/image` on Web and `react-native-fast-image` on iOS & Android.

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  src="/logo.png"
  height={100}
  width={200}
  alt="BeatGig logo"
  priority
/>
```

You can now use optimized, fast images across platforms with a single API.

A key goal of this component was to bring the `next/image` API to native. This meant porting the following features, among others:

- `src` and `srcSet` support
- `sizes` property for optimized image sizes. Uses the `Dimensions` API on native.
- `priority` property
- Relative URL paths for images in the Next.js `public` folder
- Static files via imported via `import`
- `fill` property for absolute-filled styles
- Object fit/resize modes
- React Native `style` prop support across platforms, including `transform` array, etc.
- `loader` property for custom image loaders
- Global image configuration
  - Set a global `loader` instead of a `loaderFile`
  - Configure `deviceSizes`
  - Configure `imageSizes`
  - Implemented with React Context
- `unoptimized` prop

For more, see the [`SolitoImage` docs](/usage/image).

## Next.js 13 support

Solito 2 adds support for Next.js 13.

### Links

`TextLink` and `Link` now use Next.js' `legacyBehavior` prop under the hood. No user changes are required.

Similarly, Next.js' `useRouter` hook has been tree shaken on native to avoid runtime errors from Next.js 13 on iOS and Android.

### Upgraded example monorepos

All solito example monorepos have been upgraded to Next.js 13. The following changes were made:

- Increment Next.js version in `apps/next/package.json`
- Change `react-native-reanimated` SWC plugin in `apps/next/plugins`
- Upgrade `solito` to `2.0.0` in `packages/app/package.json`
- Upgrade `react` & `react-dom` in `apps/expo/package.json` to `18.2.0`
  - If you run `expo upgrade` in `apps/expo`, this version might get downgraded. If this happens, be sure to manually upgrade to at least `18.2.0`.

### Next.js 13 Upgrade Guide

While Solito doesn't add any breaking changes to support Next.js 13, Next.js 13 itself does have [breaking changes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#breaking-changes). Please refer to [their upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading).

Since the minimum React/React DOM versions are now `18.2.0`, I recommend setting this version as a resolution in your monorepo's root `package.json` to avoid version mismatches:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0"
  }
}
```

## Native Stack `replace()`

A common point of confusion for Solito users is the `router.replace()` function. On Web, it replaces the screen as expected. But on native, it always pushes a new screen, even when using a stack.

This limitation is due to the complexity of determining a user's navigation intentions in a composable way with URLs, especially when dealing with nested navigators.

To solve this feature request, Solito 2 introduces a new `nativeBehavior` option in the `router.replace()` function:

```ts
import { useRouter } from 'solito/router'

export function Home() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const openArtists = () => {
    replace('/artists', undefined, {
      experimental: {
        nativeBehavior: 'stack-replace',
        isNestedNavigator: true,
      },
    })
  }

  // ...
}
```

By passing `nativeBehavior: 'stack-replace'`, you tell Solito to re-write your navigation action with `StackActions.replace()`. The `isNestedNavigator` property is an important way to indicate to Solito that your stack is nested inside of another navigator, such as tabs. Chances are, this property will always be `true`.

You can also use this functionality on the `Link` and `TextLink` components when `replace` is set to `true`:

```tsx
<Link
  href="/artists"
  replace
  experimental={{
    nativeBehavior: 'stack-replace',
    isNestedNavigator: true,
  }}
/>
```

For now, this feature will live behind the `experimental` flag.

## Fonts

Since Solito's custom font loading recommendations are currently quite platform-specific, you should be able to take advantage of Next.js' new [`@next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) package without any changes on the native side.

## Upgrade guide

Please follow the steps below to upgrade. This guide will use `yarn`.

1. Upgrade solito in `packages/app`:

   a. `yarn add solito`

2. Upgrade Next.js in `apps/next`:

   a. `yarn add next@latest`

3. Add resolutions for `react` and `react-dom` to `18.2.0` in your root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "18.2.0"
  }
}
```

4. See the [Next.js 13 upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading) for any other changes you need to make.

5. Upgrade `@react-navigation/native` the newest `6.x` version

- The minimum version is [`6.0.11`](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases?q=linkingcontext&expanded=true), which exposes `LinkingContext`. This is necessary for the new `stack-replace` functionality.
- This isn't a breaking change, but it will be in a future release.
- If you're using `expo-router`, you may need to set this as a yarn resolution.
  - First, remove any `@react-navigation` packages from your `package.json`s, since `expo-router` installs these for you. Next, run `yarn`, and finally `yarn why @react-navigation/native`.
  - If your version is below `6.0.11`, please add a yarn resolution to your root `package.json` with a high enough version.

6. Run `yarn` from the root of your monorepo.
