title: Expo Router
---

> This starter is outdated. We recommend using the [standard Solito starter](/starter) and using this monorepo as a reference for where to put Expo router-specific files.

You can see the monorepo and what comes installed [here](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos/with-expo-router).

## Start from Vercel

Click this button and you can instantly deploy the starter project to Vercel for free. Deploying to Vercel will create a new git repo for you too, so you don't need to clone it from the terminal.

## Start from the terminal

You can install the starter monorepo using the CLI if you prefer:

```sh
npx create-solito-app@latest -t with-expo-router
```
