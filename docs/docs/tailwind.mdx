# Tailwind CSS Starter

> This starter is outdated. We recommend using the [standard Solito starter](/starter) and using this starter as a reference for where to put Tailwind-specific files.

```sh
npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app -t with-tailwind
```

## üî¶ About

This monorepo is a starter for an Expo + Next.js app using [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev) for its styling & Solito for navigation.

## üé® Customize your theme

Open [`packages/app/design/tailwind/theme.js`](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos/with-tailwind/packages/app/design/tailwind/theme.js) to edit your theme on both Web & Native.

## üëì How it works

### Fast on every platform

NativeWind lets you use Tailwind CSS while minimizing runtime work on every platform.

### iOS and Android

Most approaches to using Tailwind in React Native do something like this at runtime:

```ts
const styles = props.className
  .split(' ')
  .map((className) => makeStyle(className))

return <View style={styles} />
```

This means that every component ends up parsing strings to construct predictable style objects.

NativeWind takes a new approach by turning `className` strings into `StyleSheet.create` objects at build time with a Babel plugin.

With all that said, the Babel plugin will get used on iOS/Android only...

### Web

NativeWind uses Next.js' `PostCSS` feature to output CSS StyleSheets.

Yes, that's right. **On Web, you're using actual Tailwind CSS.**

We aren't parsing `className` strings into objects for React Native Web to use. Instead, we're actually forwarding CSS classnames to the DOM. That means you can get responsive styles, dark mode support, & pseudo-selectors _with server-side rendering support_.

Until recently, this was a pipedream with React Native, but with the release of React Native Web 0.18, it's finally possible.

As a result, using NativeWind with React Native Web doesn't have significant overhead compared to plain old Tailwind CSS in a React website.

If you're planning on making a website with Tailwind, why not use Solito with NativeWind?

You might accidentally make a great native app along the way.

### Bringing it together

Components are written using the `styled()` higher-order component.

In your app's design system, you can start by building your own UI primitives:

```tsx
// packages/app/design/typography
import { Text } from 'react-native'
import { styled } from 'nativewind'

export const P = styled(Text, 'text-base text-black my-4')
```

Notice that you can set base styles using the second argument of `styled`.

You can then use the `className` prop, just like regular Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
<P className="dark:text-white">Solito + NativeWind</P>
```

Take a look at the [`packages/app/design`](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-monorepos/with-tailwind/packages/app/design) folder to see how components are created with ease.

> If you're reading the NativeWind docs, you might find that you can use `className` directly without using `styled`. Since this requires the Babel plugin for all platforms, it won't work with Solito. Be sure to always wrap your components with `styled`.

## üì¶ Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- `moti` for animations
- `nativewind` for theming/design (you can bring your own, too)
- Expo SDK 49
- Next.js 13
- Expo Router 2

## üóÇ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
    - `app` you'll be creating files inside of `apps/expo/app` to use file system routing on iOS and Android.
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `design` your app's design system. organize this as you please.
      - `typography` (components for all the different text styles)
      - `layout` (components for layouts)

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev: `yarn native`
  - Runs `expo start`

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).
