title: Deep Linking
---

There are many docs out there for setting up Deep Linking in your React Native app. My plan here is not to rewrite them all.

You should reference the extensive docs from React Navigation to set up Deep Linking:

- [React Navigation Deep Linking Guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/)

I will, however, give a brief overview of how you can set up all of it in a single codebase.

While React Navigation's docs cover the part for the Native app, the part you need to do for Web is a bit less documented in the world.

## TLDR

1. Set up your React Navigation [linking config](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links)
   1. Make sure you add [prefixes](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links#prefixes) correctly
2. Make sure your `app.json`/`app.config.js` has a [`scheme` property in `apps/expo`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/#setup-with-expo-projects)
3. Configure [`intentFilters`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#intentfilters) (iOS) and [`intentFilters`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#intentfilters) (Android) in your `app.json`/`app.config.js` in `apps/expo`
4. **Set up `apple-app-site-association` on your Next.js app.**
   1. This part is unique to this guide.
5. Test it out!

_Android instructions for universal linking aren't done yet. I'd accept a PR though._

### 1. Linking config

- [React Navigation Docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links)
- [Example linking config](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/blob/master/example-monorepos/blank/packages/app/provider/navigation/index.tsx)
  - Note that this example only has one prefix. If you want Universal Links to work (meaning `yourdomain.com` should open your app), be sure to add the correct [prefixes](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links#prefixes).

For example, if your website is `beatgig.com`, you might have something like this in your prefixes:

```ts
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking'

const url = 'beatgig.com'

const config = {
  prefixes: [
    Linking.createURL('/'),
    // https, including subdomains like www.
    `https://${url}/`,
    `https://*.${url}/`,
    // http, including subdomains like www.
    `http://${url}/`,
    `http://*.${url}/`,
  ],

  // ...
}
```

### 2. Scheme

2. Make sure your `app.json`/`app.config.js` has a [`scheme` property in `apps/expo`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/#setup-with-expo-projects)

```js
export default {
  scheme: 'solito', // replace with your app scheme
}
```

Your app scheme will let you link into your app. For example, if your scheme is `solito`, then `solito:///` will open the app from your iPhone.

### 3. `associatedDomains` + `intentFilters`

Your `app.json`/`app.config.js` will need to specify the domain you want to receive links from.

For example, imagine you want the app to open from `beatgig.com`. Then in `app.config.js`:

Expo docs:

- [`associatedDomains`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#associateddomains)
- [`intentFilters`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#intentfilters)

```js
const url = 'beatgig.com'

export default {
  ios: {
    // ...other ios properties
    associatedDomains: [`applinks:${url}`],
  },
  android: {
    // ...other android properties
    intentFilters: [
      {
        action: 'VIEW',
        autoVerify: true,
        data: [
          {
            scheme: 'https',
            host: `*.${url}`,
            pathPrefix: '/',
          },
        ],
        category: ['BROWSABLE', 'DEFAULT'],
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

Notice that `ios` has `applinks:` prefixing the URL.

### 4. Apple App Site association

In order to get Universal Links to work, Apple requires that your website has a file called `apple-app-site-association` on your URL, to prove that you own that URL.

#### 1. Create an API route

Create a file at this exact location in your Solito repo:

`apps/next/pages/api/.well-known/apple-app-site-association.ts`

Create the file below, and replace `BUNDLE_ID` with your app's iOS bundle ID. Your `TEAM_ID` is found on AppStore Connect when you click the icon in the top right.

Your bundle ID will look something like `com.nandorojo.app`.

```ts
const BUNDLE_ID = 'YOUR-APPLE-APP-BUNDLE-ID'
const TEAM_ID = 'YOUR-APPLE-APP-STORE-TEAM-ID'

const association = {
  applinks: {
    apps: [],
    details: [
      {
        appID: `${TEAM_ID}.${BUNDLE_ID}`,
        paths: [
          // this makes every path open your app
          // this is often not desired
          // see the Apple docs to configure this with granularity
          '*',
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
}

export default (_: NextApiRequest, response: NextApiResponse) => {
  return response.status(200).send(association)
}
```

To see more about how to configure your links, read [Apple's docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html).

By default, the above code will make any URL clicked from your phone that matches your domain open the app. To change this, you can edit the `paths` field. For example, you probably don't want someone clicking your marketing page and then deep linking into your app:

```ts
const BUNDLE_ID = 'YOUR-APPLE-APP-BUNDLE-ID'
const TEAM_ID = 'YOUR-APPLE-APP-STORE-TEAM-ID'

const association = {
  applinks: {
    apps: [],
    details: [
      {
        appID: `${TEAM_ID}.${BUNDLE_ID}`,
        // all paths, except for marketing pages
        paths: ['*', 'NOT /products/*'],
      },
    ],
  },
}

export default (_: NextApiRequest, response: NextApiResponse) => {
  return response.status(200).send(association)
}
```

#### 2. Add a redirect

Finally, Apple expects this file to exist at the exact path `yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`.

Since the file we created above is an API route, we need to create a `redirect` in `next.config.js`:

`apps/next/next.config.js`

```js
const nextConfig = {
  // ...
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/.well-known/:file',
        destination: '/api/.well-known/:file',
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}

// ...
```

Your final `next.config.js` file might look like this:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  webpack5: true,
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/.well-known/:file',
        destination: '/api/.well-known/:file',
        permanent: false,
      },
    ]
  },
}

const { withExpo } = require('@expo/next-adapter')
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins')
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')([
  'solito',
  'dripsy',
  '@dripsy/core',
  'moti',
  '@motify/core',
  '@motify/components',
  'app',
])

module.exports = withPlugins(
  [withTM, [withExpo, { projectRoot: __dirname }]],
  nextConfig
)
```

### 5. Test your app

First, you'll need to make sure you publish your website on the domain you used.

Once it's live, create a new build of your Expo app with `expo run:ios -d`. Plug your iPhone into your computer to test it out.

Next, try texting yourself a URL, and see if it deep links.
