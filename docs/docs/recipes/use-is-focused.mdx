Since `useIsFocused()` only applicable on Native, you can replace it with a custom function on Web.

## Create your exports

**`hooks/use-is-focused.ts`**

```ts twoslash
export { useIsFocused } from '@react-navigation/native'
```

**`hooks/use-is-focused.web.ts`**

```ts twoslash
export function useIsFocused() {
  return true
}
```

On Web, screens are always focused when they're mounted.

## Import your file

```ts
import { useIsFocused } from 'hooks/use-is-focused'
```

## Custom Web Logic

> This section is a little more advanced. It's relevant if you're using modals with Next Router.

In the above example, we always return `true` on Web.

One exception might be if there is a shallow routed modal on top of a screen.

For example, say that you have an `EditArtist` modal that shows when the URL contains a query param like `/@djkhaled?showsEditModal=true`.

If you want to implement this logic, you could do it yourself on Web using a combination of React Context and checking query params with `useRouter` from `next/router`.

### Create a context

First, in a file called `context/modal-screen` create your `ModalScreenContext`. This will let screens detect if they are a modal or not.

```ts twoslash
import { createContext } from 'react'

export const ModalScreenContext = createContext(false)
```

Then, your actual Next.js page could look something like this:

```tsx
// pages/artist/[slug].tsx
import { ModalScreenContext } from 'context/modal-screen'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function ArtistPage() {
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    <>
      <ArtistScreen />

      <ModalScreenContext.Provider value={true}>
        {!!router?.query?.showsEditModal && <EditArtistModal />}
      </ModalScreenContext.Provider>
    </>
  )
}
```

Notice that the `EditArtistModal` is wrapped with the `ModalScreenContext.Provider`, and the `value` is `true`.

This means that any component inside of `EditArtistModal` will know it is a modal, whereas every component inside of `ArtistScreen` will know it is _not_ a modal.

### Use the context

If you stick to the pattern of always including the word `modal` in the URL, you can use the `useRouter` hook to check if the URL contains the query param:

The logic for `useIsFocused` should now be this: your hook is focused if one of these conditions is true:

1. the hook is inside of a (mounted) modal, or
2. the hook is not a modal, and there is no modal mounted
   
   a. Why? If this hook is not in a modal, but a modal is mounted, then that means that this hook is underneath the modal, and thus not focused.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: context/modal-screen.ts
import { createContext } from 'react'
export const ModalScreenContext = createContext(false)

// @filename: use-is-focused.tsx
// ---cut---

import { useContext } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { ModalScreenContext } from './context/modal-screen'

export function useIsFocused() {
  const { query } = useRouter()
  const iAmAModal = useContext(ModalScreenContext)

  if (iAmAModal) {
    return true
  }

  const isThereAModalVisibleOnTopOfMe = 
    // check if there is a query param with "modal"
    Object.keys(query ?? {}).some((key) => key.toLowerCase().includes('modal')) 

  return !isThereAModalVisibleOnTopOfMe
}
```

To use this as a repeatable method, it's important that you always use the word `modal` as a query param to denote that a modal is open.
