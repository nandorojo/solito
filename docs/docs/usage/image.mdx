```tsx
import { SolitoImage } from 'solito/image'
```

A drop-in replacement for the [Next.js `Image` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization).

On Web, it uses `next/image`. On iOS & Android, it uses [`react-native-fast-image`](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) by Dylan Vann.

## Usage

### Remote URLs

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  src="https://beatgig.com/image.png"
  height={100}
  width={100}
  alt="A cool artist's image."
/>
```

### Local files

```tsx
import image from './image.png'

export const Image = () => (
  <SolitoImage
    src={image}
    height={100}
    width={100}
    alt="A cool image, imported locally."
  />
)
```

> Next.js will not optimize images imported via `require`.

### Public folder images

With [some configuration](#configuration), you can even use files from your Next.js website's `public` folder across platforms:

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  src="/image.png"
  height={100}
  width={100}
  alt="A cool artist's image."
/>
```

## Props

Please reference the Next.js [`Image` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image). It's useful to get acquainted with how it works before using `SolitoImage`.

The following props are supported across platforms:

- `src`
- `loader`
- `width`
- `height`
- `quality`
- `crossOrigin`
- `referrerPolicy`
- `alt`
- `fill`
- `onLoadingComplete`
- `loading`
- `priority`
- `placeholder`
- `blurDataURL` (web only)
- `sizes`
- `srcSet`
- `style` React Native style prop.
<!-- - `onLayout` -->
- `unoptimized`

## Styling

You can style the image using the `style` prop. It accepts a React Native style object.

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  style={{
    borderRadius: 6,
    transform: [
      {
        scale: 1.2,
      },
    ],
  }}
/>
```

### `fill`

If `fill` is set to `true`, the image will fill the entire container with absolute position. You don't need to set `height` and `width` with `fill`.

```tsx
<SolitoImage fill src="/my-image.png" />
```

## Image Loaders

`next/image` lets you [configure a `loader`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader) function. `solito/image` brings this functionality to iOS & Android. This is where the power of optimized images comes in, so it's useful to understand how it works.

Say you use Cloudinary as your image CDN. Your loader would look like this:

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  // this is your cloudinary image ID
  src="239409adf90.jpg"
  // these are your image's dimensions
  height={1600}
  width={900}
  quality={90}
  loader={({ quality, src, width }) => {
    const cloudinaryKey = `your-key`
    return `https://res.cloudinary.com/${cloudinaryKey}/image/upload/q_${quality},w_${width}/${src}`
  }}
/>
```

Given a `quality`, `src`, and `width`, the loader generates an image URL. Let's examine each parameter.

`src` and `quality` are simple: they're the values passed as props. `quality` will be `90`, and `src` will be `239409adf90.jpg`.

`width`, however, is different. You might think that the `width` prop passed to the `loader` will be `900`, since that's what we passed to the component. However, this is not the case.

The `width` prop passed to `SolitoImage` is meant to be the true width of the image file itself. But the `width` passed to the `loader` function could be any number.

Under the hood, the image component loops through many different image widths, creates a URL for each, and then chooses which one to use. Here's a pseudo-code example of what it does:

```tsx
// think of it like this:
const imageUrls = [100, 200, 300, 400].map((width) =>
  loader({ quality, src, width })
)

// then it chooses the best one (again, this is pseudo-code)
<img src={imageUrls.find(bestImage)} />
```

Once the image component has a set of URLs, it determines which one to use. On Web, this determination is done by the browser using the [`sizes` and `srcSet`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#resolution_switching_different_sizes) attributes on the `<img />` element.

`SolitoImage` implements `sizes` and `srcSet` logic on iOS & Android using JS with screen dimensions to achieve feature parity with Web. [(Source code)](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/blob/next13/src/image/helpers.ts#L118-L243)

To recap – `loader` is a convenient pure function to construct optimized URLs for your image.

### Circumventing loader

If you don't want to use a `loader`, you can pass `unoptimized` to your image. It will use the `src` prop as-is.

```tsx
<SolitoImage
  height={200}
  width={200}
  src="https://beatgig.com/image.png"
  unoptimized
/>
```

### Globally-configured loaders

Setting the `loader` prop on every image can get a bit tedious.

The Solito recommendation for configuring an image loader across your whole app is to use the `<SolitoImageProvider />`.

```tsx
<SolitoImageProvider
  // all image children will default to this loader
  loader={({ quality, src, width }) => {
    const cloudinaryKey = `your-key`
    return `https://res.cloudinary.com/${cloudinaryKey}/image/upload/q_${quality},w_${width}/${src}`
  }}
>
  <App />
</SolitoImageProvider>
```

To learn more about global configuration, see the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

:::tip Migrating from Next.js

If you're using a custom `loaderFile` in your `next.config.js`, you can pass the same loader function to `SolitoImageProvider`.

:::

## `public` folder

Next.js lets you add files to a `public` folder and reference them using a relative URL in your app.

For example, if you have `public/image.jpg` in your Next.js app, you can use it like so:

```tsx
<img src="/image.jpg" />
```

React Native's `Image` component doesn't have the same approach to static assets. You either need to provide an absolute URL, or import a static asset:

```tsx
// ✅ React Native allows this
<Image source={{ uri: 'https://beatgig.com/some-image.png' }} />

// ✅ React Native allows this
<Image source={require('./image.png')} />

// ❌ React Native does not allow this
<Image src="/image.png" />
```

To keep the convenient APIs of Next.js, `SolitoImage` lets you use your website's `public` folder for images across platforms:

```tsx
// ✅ SolitoImage allows this
<SolitoImage src="/image.png" />
```

In the [configuration](#configuration) section below, we'll see how this is possible.

## Configuration

Since your `images` property from `next.config.js` won't apply to React Native, Solito has a `SolitoImageProvider` to define your config instead.

This provider lets you do things like query images on your app from your website's `public` folder.

To start, wrap your app in the `SolitoImageProvider`. Next provide a `nextJsURL` prop:

```tsx
<SolitoImageProvider nextJsURL="https://beatgig.com">
  <App />
</SolitoImageProvider>
```

Under the hood, Solito will use the `nextJsURL` as the prefix for static assets that are defined as strings.

It's worth mentioning that images imported from the `public` folder will not get bundled as static assets in your iOS & Android apps. Instead, they will fetch from the network and then cache. If you want the images to bundle in your native app, you should import them directly.

### `<SolitoImageProvider />`

You can think of `SolitoImageProvider` as your `images` configuration from `next.config.js`. It accepts the following props:

- `nextJsURL`: (recommened) The URL of your Next.js app. This is used to prefix static assets that are defined as strings.
- `loader`: Globally configure an image loader function. I recommend using this for simplifying your API. See the [loaders](#loaders) docs.
- `deviceSizes`: An array defining device sizes. Matches the same default as Next.js. [See their docs.](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#device-sizes)
- `imageSizes`: An array defining image sizes. Matches the same default as Next.js. [See their docs.](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#image-sizes)
<!-- - `path`: The path to your static assets, defaulting to `/_next/image`. You probably don't need this. -->

```tsx
<SolitoImageProvider
  nextJsURL="https://beatgig.com"
  loader={({ quality, width, src }) => {
    return `https://cloudinary.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality}`
  }}
>
  <App />
</SolitoImageProvider>
```

## Object Fit

Rather than `style.objectFit`, use the `resizeMode` prop.

```tsx
<SolitoImage src="/image.png" width={200} height={200} resizeMode="cover" />
```

This behavior aligns with React Native images.

## Installation

`solito/image` requires `solito` v2+.

### Next.js

`solito/image` requires Next.js 13+.

Add the `images` configuration to your `next.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    // you might need to add this if your app imports images outside of Next.js
    // disableStaticImages: true,
  },
}
```

### Expo

`solito/image` uses `react-native-fast-image` under the hood. Since this has native code, you have to use a custom dev client instead of Expo Go.

#### With a custom dev client (recommended)

```sh
cd apps/expo
expo install react-native-fast-image
cd ../..
yarn

cd apps/expo
# install your native dependencies
npx expo prebuild
# build your development client
npx expo run:ios
# start the expo dev server for testing
npx expo start --dev-client --ios
```

#### With Expo Go

Solito Image adds support for Expo Go. However, images will not be optimized on iOS & Android, since it uses the vanilla `Image` from React Native.

First, add a module resolver plugin in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add -D babel-plugin-module-resolver
cd ../..
yarn
```

Next, edit your `apps/expo/babel.config.js` file to add a resolution from `solito/image` to `solito/image/expo`.

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true)

  return {
    presets: [['babel-preset-expo', { jsxRuntime: 'automatic' }]],
    plugins: [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin',
      [
        'module-resolver',
        {
          root: ['./'],
          alias: {
            'solito/image': 'solito/image/expo',
          },
        },
      ],
    ],
  }
}
```

For a production app, I recommend not doing this, as you will miss out on `react-native-fast-image`'s optimizations.

### Vanilla React Native

After upgrading to Solito v2, you'll need to install `react-native-fast-image`.

```sh
cd apps/expo # or wherever your react-native folder is
yarn add react-native-fast-image
npx pod-install
cd ../..
yarn
```
