id: link
title: Link
sidebar_label: <Link />

```ts
import { Link } from 'solito/link'
```

A drop-in replacement for [Next.js' `<Link />` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link). It follows the exact same API.

```tsx
<Link href="/" />
```

## Props

### `style`

`style` will not have any defaults on web. You can configure these in `globals.css` or inline with the `style` prop.

### Next.js props

`Link` supports the props from [Next.js' `<Link />` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).

## Configuration

Before a `Link` can work on iOS and Android, you'll need to properly configure your `linking` config with React Navigation.

See their docs:

- [Configuring links](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/configuring-links/) for in-app routing
- [Deep linking](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/) for handling inbound links into your app

## Wrapper components

You can easily create wrapper components for your links:

```tsx
export const ArtistLink = ({ slug }) => (
  <Link href={`/artists/${slug}`} as={`/@${slug}`} shallow>
    <View />
  </Link>
)
```

## Children recommendation

You shouldn't render a `Pressable` or `Touchable` as a child of a `Link` component. Doing so can mess with the press events on Web and cause issues with `next/router`.

```tsx
// ðŸš¨ this is bad, it uses Pressable
<Link href="/">
  <Pressable />
</Link>
```

```tsx
// âœ… this is good, it uses a View
<Link href="/">
  <View />
</Link>
```

### Workarounds

#### Disable the pressable

Sometimes, this can be tough to get around. What if you want to wrap a `Button` with a Link?

Technically, if the child touchable is `disabled`, then it won't capture touch events, so that is fine.

```tsx
// âœ… this is okay, since it's disabled
<Link href="/">
  <Pressable disabled />
</Link>
```

However, this might throw off your styling or interaction events. Chances are, you don't want to disable the button altogether. So what else can we do?

#### Use Dripsy's `as` prop

If you're using Dripsy, you can utilize the `as` prop and forward it down to your pressable:

```tsx twoslash
import { Pressable, View } from 'dripsy'
import { Link } from 'solito/link'

// your button component
const Button = ({ as, children }: React.ComponentProps<typeof Pressable>) => (
  <Pressable as={as}>{children}</Pressable>
)

export const ButtonLink = () => (
  <Link href="/">
    <Button as={View} />
  </Link>
)
```

#### Create a custom `Link` component

If you're using something like `MotiPressable`, where none of the above solutions are viable, you can create a custom `Link` component.

In order to preserve accessibility on Web for links, we'll need to utilize a few tricks.

See the [custom link](/usage/use-link) guide.

## Text Link

If you need to render a text node in your link, reference the [`<TextLink />`](/usage/text-link) docs.
