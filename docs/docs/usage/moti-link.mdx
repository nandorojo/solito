```ts
import { MotiLink } from 'solito/moti'
```

[`moti`](https://moti.fyi) is a popular animation library for React Native, powered by Reanimated 2. It works on iOS, Android and Web.

Solito provides a first-class support Moti integration with `MotiLink`. It works just like the regular `Link`, plus all the great Moti animation features.

Under the hood, `MotiLink` uses [`MotiPressable`](https://moti.fyi/interactions/overview).

## Usage

You can animate based on `hovered` and `pressed` states, without triggering any re-renders:

```tsx
const ButtonLink = ({ children, href, as }) => (
  <MotiLink
    href={href}
    as={as}
    animate={({ hovered, pressed }) => {
      'worklet'

      return {
        scale: pressed ? 0.9 : hovered ? 1.1 : 1,
      }
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </MotiLink>
)
```

Or, you could do a simple fade-in animation:

```tsx
<MotiLink href="/users/fernando" from={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>
  {children}
</MotiLink>
```

Whatever a `MotiView`/`MotiPressable` component supports, you can do with `MotiLink`.

## Props

Firstly, this component supports the following props from [Next.js' `<Link />` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link):

- `href` (required)
- `as`
- `shallow`

This component also accepts all props of `MotiPressable`:

## Prerequisites

To use `MotiLink`, you first need to install Moti and Reanimated 2. Please refer to the [Moti installation steps](https://moti.fyi/install).

You can also reference/clone the [Solito starter app](https://github.com/solito/tree/master/monorepo-examples/blank) which has Moti and Solito configured for you.
